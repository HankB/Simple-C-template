# Simple-C-template

Framework to incorporate/demostrate my C best practices

## Motivation

Provide a template where I can find what I've used in the past w/out havint to search through previous projects. This will include

* Build command in source files if appropriate.
* A real "hello world" project
*  `Makefile`
* Unit tests
* `cmake` (maybe some day.)
* `valgrind` command
* Proper use of `const` for `char*` types. I hope!

C sources will be formatted using the default for VS Code (`C/C++ Extension Pack` installed.) Invoke using `<shift><ctrl>I`. Makefiles too if it works for them.
